# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the Klingon Universal Translator with security updates:

| Version | Supported          | Notes                    |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |

## üîí Security Considerations

While the Klingon Universal Translator is a client-side application with no backend infrastructure, we take security seriously and consider several important aspects:

### Client-Side Security

- **XSS Prevention**: All user input is properly sanitized before display
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented to prevent injection attacks
- **Safe External Links**: All external references are validated
- **Secure Dependencies**: Regular audits of npm packages for vulnerabilities
- **Privacy Protection**: No user data collection or tracking

### Data Handling

- **Local Storage Only**: All data remains on user's device
- **No Analytics Tracking**: No personal information collected
- **Speech API Privacy**: Audio processing handled by browser APIs only
- **Translation Privacy**: No translations sent to external services

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us maintain the security of the project by following responsible disclosure:

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing to the project, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Input Validation

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Validate and sanitize user input
const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  return input
    .replace(/<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>/gi, '')
    .replace(/javascript:/gi, '')
    .trim();
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Direct use of user input
dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userInput }}
```

#### Safe External References

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Validate external URLs
const isValidUrl = (url: string): boolean => {
  try {
    const parsed = new URL(url);
    return ["https:", "http:"].includes(parsed.protocol);
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Unvalidated external links
window.open(userProvidedUrl);
```

#### Secure Local Storage

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Validate data from localStorage
const getStoredData = (key: string): unknown => {
  try {
    const data = localStorage.getItem(key);
    return data ? JSON.parse(data) : null;
  } catch {
    // Handle corrupted data gracefully
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
    return null;
  }
};
```

### For Users

- **Keep Browser Updated**: Use the latest browser version for security patches
- **Review Permissions**: Check what permissions the app requests
- **Secure Environment**: Use the app on trusted devices and networks
- **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious behavior immediately

## üîç Security Auditing

### Automated Security Checks

We use several tools to maintain security:

- **npm audit**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Automated security updates for dependencies
- **ESLint Security Rules**: Static analysis for common security issues
- **Content Security Policy**: Browser-level protection against XSS

### Manual Security Reviews

- Code review process includes security considerations
- Periodic security audits by maintainers
- Community security reviews during major releases

### Dependency Management

```json
// We maintain secure dependencies with regular updates
{
  "scripts": {
    "audit": "npm audit --audit-level moderate",
    "audit:fix": "npm audit fix",
    "security:check": "npm run audit && npm run lint:security"
  }
}
```
